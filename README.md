# Psychic-Game 
This is a simple letter guessing game. Players will have nine chances to guess the letter that the program randomly generates. It will keep track of the wins and losses, throughout as many rounds as the player is willing to play. The game will alert the winner if they guess the letter that they came up with, or inform the loser that they lost after they've guessed nine different letters. 

## Running the app

In this game a user will attempt to guess the letter that is randomly generated. You will have 9 attempts to guess the letter. After 9 guesses, you will be informed that you lost (assuming you didn't guess the correct letter) and your score will indicate that. If the user does manage to get the letter before your guesses run out, the user will be informed and their score will demonstrate that they won.
